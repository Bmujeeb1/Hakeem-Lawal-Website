<h2>My autobiography</h2>
<title>camille's autobiography</title> 
</head> 
	 	<body>My name is Camille Joy T. Redoble and I was born on the 10th of November,2007 in Sta.Lucia Disctrict Hospital. 
	       My parents names are Michael Redoble and Joan Redoble. I have 2 siblings,we are 3 in total and we are all girls.
	       
	      <p></p> There are a lot of things I like and i dont. I like to have fun with my friends, I love watching anime, and listening to kpop,
	       but what I really love is reading comics. I reads comics when I have free time. Some of my friends asking me "why you like reading comics a lot?"
	       well Comic books combine the depth and imagination of books with the visuals of movies, and don't have to worry about making something look realistic. When reading a comic book, the art creates the world. It may look cartoony compared to reality, but it's 'real' in terms of that one comic.
	       It also gives me happiness and peace.
	       <p></p>The things I dont like are raisins, I dont know why I dont like the taste of raisin but I like grapes. 
	       The other foods I dont like is ''paksiw'' my parents says it taste good and yummy but my mouth says no.
	       <p></p>My goals in life are to study hard, be my dream job and give my family a better life.
	       I also have a inspirational qoute and I would like to share it â€œTrust yourself that you can do it" 
	       this quote is by Baz Luhrmann. I always relay my life to this qoute, this means eve how hard life is I would still
	       fight, even if a lot of works to do I will accomplish it and even there is the time you wanted to give up just talk to go, "you can do it"
	       I am also inspired by my granmother.
